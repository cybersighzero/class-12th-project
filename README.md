# Class 12 Final Project – Game Center (Python)

This is my official Class 12 Computer Science project, submitted as part of the final practical examination.  
It features a Game Center application in Python that includes **user authentication**, **Rock-Paper-Scissors**, and an **Encryptor/Decryptor** — all connected via a smooth, menu-driven interface.

## What It Does

Upon launching, the program:
- Asks if the user wants to log in or register
- Supports password resets and stores user credentials securely using a `.csv` file
- Offers two main mini-games:
  1. **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: Play against the computer
  2. **Encryptor/Decryptor**: Convert messages using basic ASCII shifting

All activity is logged into a file called `GAME_CENTER!.csv`.

## Features

- User registration, login, and password reset
- Rock-Paper-Scissors with result tracking
- Text encryption and decryption using basic ASCII cipher
- Data persistence via CSV files (`users.csv`, `GAME_CENTER!.csv`)
- Menu-driven flow between games
- Clean and modular code with reusable functions

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **CSV module** for file handling
- **Random module** for computer-generated choices
- Simple logic-based encryption (Caesar cipher style)
